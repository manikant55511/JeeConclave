---
1. Measuring study time instead of the topic content covered and mastered.
2. Felt lost and misguided.
3. Working hard and not getting results
4. Have no focus and consistency.
5. Neglecting weak topics .

This is where mentorship comes into play. We donâ€™t want you to get stuck just because no one was around to guide you.
