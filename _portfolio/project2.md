* Mentorship- Needed by all to make an effective improvement in their performance.
* Chances- Whether it be CBSE or JEE you get at max 2 chances and we know how important it is for you. 
* Inclusion of everybody-This means that mentorship and teaching should be available to everyone not only in metros and big cities but also from remote areas.
* Quality of information-Even if we have to sacrifice ease of operation a little bit, the increase in quality takes precedence.
* Zero tolerance-towards miscreants, spammers and marketers who care about nothing except their profit.
